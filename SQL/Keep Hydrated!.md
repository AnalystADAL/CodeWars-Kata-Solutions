Nathan loves cycling.

Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.

You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded down.

For example:

hours = 3 ----> liters = 1

hours = 6.7---> liters = 3

hours = 11.8--> liters = 5

Input data is available from the table cycling, which has 2 columns: id and hours. For each row, you have to return 3 columns: id, hours and liters (not litres, it's a difference from the kata description)

---

```sql
SELECT *, floor(hours / 2) AS liters FROM cycling
```
